                            Momo is a type of East and South Asian steamed filled dumpling, popular across the Indian subcontinent and the Himalayan regions of South Asia.Momos are native to Southwest Chinese region of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, North Indian region of Ladakh,Northeast Indian regions of Sikkim, Assam, and Arunachal Pradesh,and East Indian region of Darjeeling.It is similar to Chinese baozi, jiaozi, and mantou, Mongolian buuz, Japanese gyoza, Korean mandu and Turkic manti, but heavily influenced by cuisine of the Indian subcontinent with Indian spices and herbs. Momos are extremely popular among the natives of the Indian subcontinent, and can be found in every kind of shop from restaurants to street vendors.


                            The exact origins are unclear, but the name's etymology points to northern China (饃饃). The food is thought to have been spread by caravan routes connecting the Central Asian steppe to both East and West. Momo-like filled dumplings, called by a closely associated group of words, exist in Mongolian, Turkish, Persian, Uzbek, and many other Central and East Asian cuisines.(For more, see entries on Mantou, Manti, and Buuz.)
                            
                            As for the Himalayan momo, the dish is believed to have spread from Tibet along with the influx of the Tibetan diaspora. Since this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling Newar merchants brought the recipe and the name momo from Tibet where the Newar Merchants used to go to trade. Originally, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak, due to the scarcity of vegetables in Tibet. However, after arriving in North Indian plains, the momo was made vegetarian in the modern era to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus.


                            There are typically two types of momo, steamed and fried. Momo is usually served with a dipping sauce (locally called chutney/achhar), normally made with tomato as the base ingredient. Soup momo is a dish with steamed momo immersed in a meat or vegetable broth. Pan-fried momo is also known as kothey momo. Steamed momo served in hot sauce is called C-momo. There are also a variety of dumplings of Nepal found in the Indian state of Sikkim and Darjeeling district, including tingmo and thaipo.
